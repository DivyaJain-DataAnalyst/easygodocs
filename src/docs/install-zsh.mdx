# Install Zsh

Zsh (Z shell) is an extended Bourne shell with many features, including improved completion, spelling correction, and theming capabilities.

## Step 1: Install zsh

Install Zsh using the apt package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh -y
```

This installs the latest version of Zsh available in your Ubuntu repositories.

## Step 2: Check version

Verify that Zsh was installed successfully:

```bash
zsh --version
```

You should see output similar to `zsh 5.8.1 (x86_64-ubuntu-linux-gnu)`.

## Step 3: Set zsh as default shell

Change your default shell to Zsh:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

You'll be prompted to enter your password to confirm the change.

## Step 4: Restart terminal

Close and reopen your terminal to start using Zsh as your default shell.

Alternatively, you can start a new Zsh session without changing your default shell:

```bash
zsh
```

## Verify the change

After restarting your terminal, verify that Zsh is your default shell:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

You should see `/usr/bin/zsh` as the output.
