# Getting Started with React

Welcome to the React documentation! This guide will help you understand the basics of React and how to get started building user interfaces.

## What is React?

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It lets you compose complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called 'components'.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js and npm:** React applications are built using Node.js. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

---

## Setup a React Project

The easiest way to set up a new React project is by using **Create React App**.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will create a new directory called `my-app` with a basic React project structure and start a development server.

---

## File Structure

A typical React project has the following structure:

```
my-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

- **`public/`**: Contains the main HTML file and other static assets.
- **`src/`**: Contains the React components and application logic.

---

## Core Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be either functional or class-based.

**Functional Component:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

**Class Component:**

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Welcome extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

export default Welcome;
```

### JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your React components.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### Props

Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

```jsx
// Parent Component
import React from 'react';
import Welcome from './Welcome';

function App() {
  return <Welcome name="John" />;
}

export default App;
```

### State

State is used to manage data that can change over time within a component.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Component Lifecycle

Class components have lifecycle methods that allow you to run code at specific times.

- **`componentDidMount()`**: Runs after the component is added to the DOM.
- **`componentDidUpdate()`**: Runs after the component's props or state change.
- **`componentWillUnmount()`**: Runs just before the component is removed from the DOM.

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

- **`useState`**: For managing state.
- **`useEffect`**: For handling side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).
- **`useContext`**: For accessing context.

---

## Styling in React

There are several ways to style React components:

- **CSS Stylesheets:** Import a CSS file into your component.
- **Inline Styles:** Apply styles directly to an element.
- **CSS-in-JS Libraries:** Use libraries like `styled-components` or `Emotion`.

---

## React Router

React Router is a library for handling navigation in a React application.

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
      <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    </Router>
  );
}
```
