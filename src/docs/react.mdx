# React Guide

Welcome to the React documentation! This guide will help you understand the basics of React and how to get started building user interfaces.

## What is React?

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It lets you compose complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called 'components'.

## Getting Started

- Install Node.js and npm
- Create a new React app using Create React App: `npx create-react-app my-app`
- Navigate to your app folder: `cd my-app`
- Start the development server: `npm start`

## Core Concepts

- **Components:** The building blocks of React UIs.
- **JSX:** A syntax extension for writing UI markup in JavaScript.
- **Props:** Data passed to components.
- **State:** Data managed within a component.
- **Hooks:** Functions that let you use state and other React features.

## Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused.
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Lift state up when needed.
- Use keys for list rendering.
- Write reusable and testable code.
