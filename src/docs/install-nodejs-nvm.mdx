# Install Node.js using nvm

nvm (Node Version Manager) allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your system.

## Step 1: Install nvm

Download and install nvm using the official install script:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This downloads the latest version of nvm and adds it to your shell configuration.

## Step 2: Verify nvm installation

Check that nvm was installed successfully:

```bash
nvm --version
```

You should see output similar to `0.39.3`.

## Step 3: Install latest LTS Node.js

Install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

This installs the most recent LTS version available.

## Step 4: Check installed version

Verify that Node.js and npm are working:

```bash
node -v && npm -v
```

This command shows both Node.js and npm versions.

## Additional nvm commands

### List available Node.js versions
```bash
nvm list-remote
