# Generate SSH Key for GitHub

SSH keys provide a secure way to authenticate with GitHub without entering your password each time.

## Step 1: Generate SSH key

Generate a new SSH key pair using the Ed25519 algorithm:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

When prompted:
- Press Enter to accept the default file location
- Enter a secure passphrase (recommended) or press Enter for no passphrase

## Step 2: Start ssh-agent

Start the SSH agent in the background:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

This command starts the SSH agent and adds it to your current session.

## Step 3: Add SSH private key to agent

Add your private key to the SSH agent:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

If you set a passphrase, you'll be prompted to enter it.

## Step 4: Copy public key to clipboard

Copy your public key to the clipboard for easy pasting:

```bash
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

If `xclip` is not installed, you can install it with `sudo apt install xclip`.

## Step 5: Add key to GitHub

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click your profile picture â†’ Settings
3. Click "SSH and GPG keys" in the sidebar
4. Click "New SSH key"
5. Give it a descriptive title
6. Paste your public key in the "Key" field
7. Click "Add SSH key"

## Step 6: Test the connection

Test your SSH connection to GitHub:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

## Next Steps

Now you can:
- Clone repositories using SSH URLs
- Push and pull without entering passwords
- Use SSH for secure Git operations
