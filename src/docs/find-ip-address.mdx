# Find Your IP Address

Knowing your IP address is useful for networking, troubleshooting, and server configuration.

## Step 1: Open terminal

Press `Ctrl+Alt+T` to open the terminal.

## Step 2: Show all IP addresses

Display detailed network interface information:

```bash
ip addr show
```

This shows all network interfaces with their IP addresses, MAC addresses, and status.

## Step 3: Show only IPv4 address

Get just your IPv4 address in a simple format:

```bash
hostname -I
```

This command shows all IPv4 addresses assigned to your system.

## Step 4: Verify network connectivity

Test your internet connection:

```bash
ping google.com -c 4
```

The `-c 4` flag sends exactly 4 ping packets and then stops.

## Additional IP address commands
