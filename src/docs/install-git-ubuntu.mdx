# Install Git on Ubuntu

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others.

## Step 1: Update package lists

First, update your package lists to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

## Step 2: Install Git

Install Git using the apt package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```

The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to prompts during installation.

## Step 3: Verify installation

Check that Git was installed successfully by checking its version:

```bash
git --version
```

You should see output similar to `git version 2.34.1`.

## Step 4: Configure Git username and email

Set up your Git identity for commits:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

Replace "Your Name" and "you@example.com" with your actual name and email address.

## Next Steps

Now that Git is installed, you can:
- Initialize a new repository with `git init`
- Clone existing repositories with `git clone`
- Start tracking changes in your projects
