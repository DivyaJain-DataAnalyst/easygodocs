# Kill Process on a Port

Sometimes you need to terminate a process that's using a specific port, especially when developing applications.

## Step 1: Find process using port (example: 3000)

Identify which process is using the port:

```bash
sudo lsof -t -i:3000
```

This command returns the Process ID (PID) of the process using port 3000.

## Step 2: Kill process

Terminate the process using its PID:

```bash
sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:3000)
```

The `-9` flag forces the process to terminate immediately.

## Step 3: Verify port is free

Check that the port is now available:

```bash
sudo lsof -i:3000
```

If no output is shown, the port is free.

## Step 4: Done

The process is terminated and the port is now available for use.

## Alternative methods

### Using netstat
```bash
# Find process
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :3000

# Kill by PID
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

### Using ss command
```bash
# Find process
sudo ss -tulpn | grep :3000

# Kill by PID
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

### Using fuser
```bash
# Kill process on port
sudo fuser -k 3000/tcp
```

## Common port conflicts

### Development servers
- Port 3000 - React development server
- Port 8080 - Common web server port
- Port 5000 - Flask development server
- Port 8000 - Django development server

### Database ports
- Port 5432 - PostgreSQL
- Port 3306 - MySQL
- Port 27017 - MongoDB

## Safety tips

### Check what you're killing
```bash
# See process details before killing
ps aux | grep <PID>
```

### Use graceful shutdown first
```bash
# Try graceful termination first
sudo kill <PID>

# Force kill if needed
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

### Check for multiple processes
```bash
# List all processes on a port
sudo lsof -i:3000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission denied
```bash
# Use sudo for system processes
sudo lsof -i:3000
```

### Port still in use
```bash
# Check if process restarted
sudo lsof -i:3000

# Check for zombie processes
ps aux | grep defunct
```

## Next Steps

Now you can:
- Free up ports for development
- Troubleshoot port conflicts
- Manage running services
- Restart applications cleanly
