# Install Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.

## Step 1: Update package lists

First, update your package lists:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

## Step 2: Install Docker Compose

Install Docker Compose using the apt package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```

This installs Docker Compose from Ubuntu's official repositories.

## Step 3: Verify version

Check that Docker Compose was installed successfully:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

You should see output similar to `Docker Compose version v2.20.0`.

## Step 4: Done

You can now run multi-container applications using Docker Compose.

## Alternative: Install latest version

For the latest version, you can install Docker Compose directly:

```bash
# Download the latest version
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Make it executable
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Verify installation
docker-compose --version
```

## Basic Docker Compose usage

### Create a docker-compose.yml file
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
```

### Start services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stop services
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View logs
```bash
docker-compose logs
```

## Next Steps

Now that Docker Compose is installed, you can:
- Define multi-container applications
- Manage complex deployments
- Use environment variables and volumes
- Scale services easily
