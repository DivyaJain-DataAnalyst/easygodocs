Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. npm is the default package manager for Node.js.

## Step 1: Update package lists

First, update your package lists to ensure you have the latest information:

This command installs both Node.js and npm together.

## Step 3: Verify Node.js version

Check that Node.js was installed successfully:

```bash
node -v
